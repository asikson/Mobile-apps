# Mobile apps

This repo contains 3 applications for Android, written in Javascript & React Native:

### Photo gallery :camera:
The program fetches images from the phone camera roll and enables to browse them in a custom gallery. 
The user can scroll them by gestures and get their fullscreen preview.

### Extended Tic Tac Toe game :x: :o:
The game is a classic tic tac toe with dimensions 10x10. The winner must get a 5-sign streak.
The program enables 2 player mode, as well as a game with the AI, however - it's not that efficient since it wasn't the purpose of the task.
The app can also write the best score (most wins in a row) to the phone's memory.

### Puzzle game :milky_way:
The game has 10 images that are programmaticaly cut into 12 pieces and shuffled.
In order to win the game, the user has to put them by gestures on the appropriate places.
The game screen contains also a timer measuring the time needed to put each image together.
